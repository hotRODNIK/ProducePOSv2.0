# ProducePOSv2.0
This repository contains an entirely redesigned version of ProducePOS. 
I redesigned the databases slightly and added some more features such as sales tracking and PLU maintenance. 
I do realize there are some shortcoming in the sales system, but I have other things to do which are quite frankly more important than this.
This major overhaul was undertaken due to boredom from the current situation.
I would like to give credit to the other group members in COIS 2240 who helped make the initial version of this system.
